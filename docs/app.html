<p class="app"> <img class="cool" src="IMG_4103.jpeg" alt="" width="400" height="400"> <br> <br> <br> Erik Keifer, a senior at Northport High school, class of 2021. Erik is an avid sports enthusiast and plays basketball, baseball and runs track.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, as people are required to be socially distant, it occurred to him that we must still somehow communicate and share our interests and ideas. He thought that a trivia game contest would be fun and challenging. In order to achieve this goal Erik envisioned an app that could bring people together all over the world who are in self isolation and lonely. Accordingly, Erik created the idea for this app and is in charge of developing the questions and the blog. All users of the app have a chance to not only play trivia but also have access to a daily blog where they can voice their opinions about issues they want to share. Keifer believes this app will be revolutionary in bringing people together from all different walks of life. </p>
